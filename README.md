# LeetCode-Effective-Grind :fire: 

5 STEPS YOU SHOULD FOLLOW :
* What are the most relevant problems?

recommend that you do when you're studying LeetCode is make sure you actually focus on what are going to be the most relevant problems. There're so many problems on LeetCode. Right now I think there are almost 1,200 problems on LeetCode, if not more. And so in your interview prep, you're never going to study all those problems. You could... even if you did go through them all, you're really not going to remember them. And so it's really important that you think about, like, what are the problems that are most likely to come up in my interview. When we've done research, we've found that it's a pretty small number of problems that come up, like, 90% of the time. So if you just focus on those problems, you're gonna get so much more bang for your buck. And there are a couple places that you can find the most popular problems on LeetCode and the ones that are most useful. So first of all, if you have a LeetCode Premium Subscription, you can see here that we can actually sort by the frequency. And that, I believe, is the frequency of how often people see the problems in their interviews. So this is a great place to start. You could do like the top hundred or so. A couple other places that you can look are we have this top 100 'like' and top 100 most popular questions on LeetCode. And those are available to everybody. So this is a great place to just look. You can see a list and go and just dig in. And it's a really great place where, if you're not sure where to start or if you just have a few free minutes, go on the list. Go to the first problem on that list that you haven't already done and it's a great place to just jump in. And finally, I'll link to this in the description below, but there's also this list on TeamBlind of some of the most popular questions that some people have put together. You can also just google like 'LeetCode best problems' or things like that. There are a lot of different results where people have compiled their favorites. And also - shameless plug - we have a 50 questions guide as well over at byte by byte that you can check out that I would highly encourage you. It's byte-by-byte.com/50-questions and there is a link in the description for that below as well. So those are a couple places that you can find some of the most popular questions that you're most likely to get asked in your interview, so that you can actually focus on what is likely to come up and not just do everything.

* Understand the goal
* Start with easy problems
* Simulate the real world
* Plan for when you get stuck
