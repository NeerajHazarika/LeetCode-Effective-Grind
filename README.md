# LeetCode-Effective-Grind :fire: 

5 STEPS YOU SHOULD FOLLOW :
* What are the most relevant problems?

It is recommended that when you're studying in LeetCode make sure you actually focus on what are going to be the most relevant problems. There're so many problems on LeetCode. And so in your interview prep, you're never going to study all those problems. Even if you did go through them all, you're really not going to remember them. And so it's really important that you think about, like, what are the problems that are most likely to come up in my interview. Based on research it is found that it's a pretty small number of problems that come up, like, 90% of the time. So if you just focus on those problems, you're gonna get so much more bang for your buck. And there are a couple places that you can find the most popular problems on LeetCode and the ones that are most useful. So first of all, if you have a LeetCode Premium Subscription, you can see here that we can actually sort by the frequency. And that, I believe, is the frequency of how often people see the problems in their interviews. So this is a great place to start. You could do like the top hundred or so. A couple other places that you can look are we have this top 100 'like' and top 100 most popular questions on LeetCode. And those are available to everybody. So this is a great place to just look. You can see a list and go and just dig in. And it's a really great place where, if you're not sure where to start or if you just have a few free minutes, go on the list. Go to the first problem on that list that you haven't already done and it's a great place to just jump in. And finally, I'll link to this in the description below, but there's also this list on TeamBlind of some of the most popular questions that some people have put together. You can also just google like 'LeetCode best problems' or things like that. There are a lot of different results where people have compiled their favorites. And also a 50 questions guide as well over at byte by byte that you can check out that I would highly encourage you. It's byte-by-byte.com/50-questions . So those are a couple places that you can find some of the most popular questions that you're most likely to get asked in your interview, so that you can actually focus on what is likely to come up and not just do everything.

* Understand the goal

First of all, you want to understand the goal, right. Understand the goal of what are you trying to accomplish with your time on LeetCode. What are you trying to accomplish with your time solving these problems? And the answer is that the goal is not to just look at the problem. The goal is actually to understand how the problem works so that... not so that you can solve that problem in the future, but so that you know how to solve similar problems in the future. And so it's really important that you focus on understanding, like, how to solve the problems, rather than focusing on what is the solution to the problem. So for example, if you get stuck on a problem... If you're going through a problem, you wantto spend about 30 minutes working on the problem before you give up. Because if you just give up after five minutes, you're never really going togive yourself a chance to even try and figure it out. But if you do get to the point of you're 30 minutes into the problem and you can't figure out what to do and you're totally stuck, you can look at thesolution. But then you have to understand what you need to do with that. So when you look at the solution, the goal is not to say, 'Oh, this is how it works...' The goalis to understand the thought process behind the solution. The goal is to say, 'I'm looking at the solution and how could I, in my own head, have come up withthis solution? What is the thought process that would have taken me fromthat original question to this solution?' Because if you understand that, then rather than just having to memorize the solution, if you understand that, you'llbe able to actually then go and solve it yourself when you see it in the future. So it's all about understanding an underlying thought process and not justunderstanding the solution itself.

* Start with easy problems

So the next strategy I would suggest for you is starting with easy problems and then working your way up. So frequently I see people start with... they're like, 'I'm gonna do a medium problem or a hard problem...' and then they get totally demoralized because it's like they're starting above their skill level. And of course we want to push ourselves and we want to challenge ourselves, but we also want to make sure that we are giving ourselves the best chance of success. And so if you're doing stuff that's too hard, it's really easy to give up and it's really easy to like not make any progress because you're just like, 'I don't even understand what's going on here...' And so you want to start with the easy problems and work your way up. So I would encourage you with whatever sort of set of problems you're starting with, do the easy problems first, then the medium, then the hard and that way you're gonna sort of build up as you go. It's a really simple tactic, but it's gonna allow you to make sure that you are continually pushing yourself to improve, but you're not just like jumping way off the deep end and not having that success.

* Simulate the real world
* Plan for when you get stuck
