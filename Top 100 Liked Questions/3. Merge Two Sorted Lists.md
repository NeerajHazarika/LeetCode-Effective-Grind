# [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

# Example 1:
* Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
* Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

# Example 2:
Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []

# Example 3:
* Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
* Output: [0]
 
# Constraints:
* The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
* Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

# My wrong approach 
* I wasnt even able to come with a error free or runtime error free code.
* This was my last attempt at it.

    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        head=ans=ListNode
        
        while l1!=None and l2!=None:
            if l1!=None :
                if l1.val<l2.val:
                    ans=l1
                    ans.next=l1.next
                    l1=l1.next
                    ans=ans.next
            elif l2!=None:
                if l2[i]<l1[i]:
                    ans=l2
                    ans.next=l2.next
                    l2=l2.next
                    ans=ans.next
        return head
```
# What did I miss ?
* I didnt know how to initialize a linked list `dummyHead = curHead = LinkedList(0)`
* I did not know how to access linked list elements ` l1.values `
* I didnt know that there should also be a temporary/dummy head node to return the final linked list ` return dummyHead.next `
* I didnt know how to traverse the linked list ` curHead.next=l1 , curHead = curHead.next , l1 = l1.next `
* I got to know that merge sort implimentation is similar

# Correct forum approach [ time : O(n+m) ]
* First we initialize a dummy head and dummy linkedlist to a random address and first node value as 0 `dummyHead = curHead = ListNode(0)`.
* Now we create a while loop with exit condition as end of list of both linked list l1 and l2 given to us.
* In each iteration of the loop, we check which node has less value between l1 and l2 linked list.
* Whichever has smaller value is added to dummy linked list that we created.
* If in case for l1 it has reach end of linked list still loop continues since exit condition is for both linked list to reach its end.
* And if in case any one of the linked list was empty it would never enter the loop, in such a case we make two if condition at the end where if any one linked list is empty we can just return the other as resultant sorted linked list.
* But if it does enter the while loop, then we now return the dummy linked list from the 2nd node since the first node is 0. We do it through the dummy head that we initialize at the beginning of our code `dummyHead.next`.

            if l1.val <= l2.val:
                curHead.next = l1
                curHead = curHead.next
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                curHead.next = l2
                curHead = curHead.next
                l2 = l2.next
                
        if l1 != None: curHead.next = l1
        if l2 != None: curHead.next = l2

# Merge Sort Algorithm
Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works on the principle of Divide and Conquer. Merge sort repeatedly breaks down a list into several sublists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.

### A merge sort works as follows: 

**Top-down Merge Sort Implementation:**

The top-down merge sort approach is the methodology which uses recursion mechanism. It starts at the Top and proceeds downwards, with each recursive turn asking the same question such as “What is required to be done to sort the array?” and having the answer as, “split the array into two, make a recursive call, and merge the results.”, until one gets to the bottom of the array-tree.

Example: Let us consider an example to understand the approach better.

1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each comprising 1 element (a list of 1 element is supposed sorted).

Top-down Implementation

2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce newly sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

### Merging of two lists done as follows:
The first element of both lists is compared. If sorting in ascending order, the smaller element among two becomes a new element of the sorted list. This procedure is repeated until both the smaller sublists are empty and the newly combined sublist covers all the elements of both the sublists.

### Python Code :
```
# Python program for implementation of MergeSort
def mergeSort(arr):
	if len(arr) > 1:

		# Finding the mid of the array
		mid = len(arr)//2

		# Dividing the array elements
		L = arr[:mid]

		# into 2 halves
		R = arr[mid:]

		# Sorting the first half
		mergeSort(L)

		# Sorting the second half
		mergeSort(R)

		i = j = k = 0

		# Copy data to temp arrays L[] and R[]
		while i < len(L) and j < len(R):
			if L[i] < R[j]:
				arr[k] = L[i]
				i += 1
			else:
				arr[k] = R[j]
				j += 1
			k += 1

		# Checking if any element was left
		while i < len(L):
			arr[k] = L[i]
			i += 1
			k += 1

		while j < len(R):
			arr[k] = R[j]
			j += 1
			k += 1

# Code to print the list


def printList(arr):
	for i in range(len(arr)):
		print(arr[i], end=" ")
	print()


# Driver Code
if __name__ == '__main__':
	arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
	print("Given array is", end="\n")
	printList(arr)
	mergeSort(arr)
	print("Sorted array is: ", end="\n")
	printList(arr)
```
