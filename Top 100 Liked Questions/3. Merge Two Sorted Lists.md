# [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

# Example 1:
* Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
* Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

# Example 2:
Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []

# Example 3:
* Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
* Output: [0]
 
# Constraints:
* The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
* Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

# Correct forum approach [ time : O(n+m) ]
* First we initialize a dummy head and dummy linkedlist to a random address and first node value as 0 `dummyHead = curHead = ListNode(0)`
* Now we create a while loop with exit condition as end of list of both linked list l1 and l2 given to us
* In each iteration of the loop, we check which node has less value between l1 and l2 linked list
* Whichever has smaller value is added to dummy linked list that we created
* If in case for l1 it has reach end of linked list still loop continues since exit condition is for both linked list to reach its end
* And if in case any one of the linked list was empty it would never enter the loop, in such a case we make two if condition at the end where if any one linked list is empty we can just return the other as resultant sorted linked list
* But if it does enter the while loop, then we now return the dummy linked list from the 2nd node since the first node is 0. We do it through the dummy head that we initialize at the beginning of our code `dummyHead.next`
```
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummyHead = curHead = ListNode(0)
        while l1 != None and l2 != None:
            if l1.val <= l2.val:
                curHead.next = l1
                curHead = curHead.next
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                curHead.next = l2
                curHead = curHead.next
                l2 = l2.next
                
        if l1 != None: curHead.next = l1
        if l2 != None: curHead.next = l2
        return dummyHead.next
